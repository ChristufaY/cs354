# CS354 – Machine Organization and Programming (Spring 2021)

This repository contains coursework and programming assignments from CS354 at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The course focuses on understanding how computers execute programs at the hardware level, including concepts such as memory management, x86 assembly, C programming, and operating system fundamentals.

---

## 🧠 Course Focus

- Low-level programming in C and x86 assembly
- Memory hierarchy and management (stack, heap, pointers)
- System calls and process control
- Debugging with `gdb` and `valgrind`
- Implementing core operating system behaviors

---

## 📁 Key Projects & Assignments

### 🔹 x86 Assembly Projects
- **Binary Bomb Lab**: Reverse-engineered an executable using `gdb` and disassembled x86 to defuse logical "bombs".
- **x86 Assembly Exercises**: Learned calling conventions, control flow, and register manipulation by writing assembly code from scratch.

### 🔹 C Programming Projects
- **Memory Allocation**: Reimplemented simplified versions of `malloc()` and `free()` to manage dynamic memory with manual bookkeeping.
- **Shell Implementation**: Created a basic Unix shell in C, supporting command parsing, background processes, and signal handling.
- **Pointer and Stack Exercises**: Practiced pointer arithmetic, function call frames, and stack organization.

### 🔹 Debugging and Analysis
- Used tools like `gdb`, `valgrind`, and `objdump` to analyze memory leaks, stack frames, and low-level program flow.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Gained a deep understanding of how software interacts with hardware.
- Built confidence in debugging and system-level programming.
- Learned to reason about runtime behavior, memory safety, and performance at a low level.

## 🛠 Tools & Languages

- C (GCC)
- x86 Assembly
- `gdb`, `valgrind`, `make`
- Linux/Unix terminal environment
